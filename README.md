# Rawrify (Work-In-Progress)
### An ultra-lightweight general utility API
### Created and maintained by @Han-Lon

## What is it?
Simply put, Rawrify is an ultra-lightweight general purpose API that you can use for
things like getting your public IPv4 address, quickly encoding files/strings as base64, and so on.

## How do I use it?
[Refer to the wiki for instructions.](https://github.com/Han-Lon/rawrify/wiki) 
The rest of this README are for the infrastructure and app code that support Rawrify.



## Feature Roadmap
- v0.3 (TBD)
  - Basic encryption/decryption (maybe), will function similar to Base64 encoding but with an encryption key
  - Temperature/weather lookup for latitude/longitude location using Weather.gov API
  - Better error handling
- v0.2
  - IPv4, IPv6, and user agent lookup
  - Base64 encoding/decoding
