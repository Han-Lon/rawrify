After `pip install`-ing requests-toolbelt into a new Python virtual evironment, copy the contents of site-packges into here.

Should look something like this:
```
requests-toolbelt-layer
  |
   python
         |
          bin
          certifi
          charset-normalizer
          idna
          requests
          requests_toolbelt
          urllib3
          <all_the_other_dist-info_dirs>
```
