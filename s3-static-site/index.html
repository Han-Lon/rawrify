    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
    An ultra-lightweight, easy-to-use, free, and open-source utility API for retrieving
    things like a client's IP address, user-agent, quick base64 encoding/decoding, and so on.
    Refer to routes and the <a href="https://github.com/Han-Lon/rawrify/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> for more info on what Rawrify can do.
    </p>
    <h2>How can I learn to use this?</h2>
    <p>
    Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Han-Lon/rawrify/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official documentation</a> for in-depth examples of and explanations of how to use Rawrify.
    </p>
    <h2>Why would I need a tool like this?</h2>
    Programmatic access to information like IP address, user agent, base64 data, and so on
    serves a variety of purposes. <br><br>
    - For example, say your program executes on a remote host and needs to grab the host's IP address. Just query
    Rawrify for the public IP and you're good to go. <br>
    - Another example, say you're building infrastructure using Terraform and want to dynamically assign your own public
    IP address to a security group (a real use-case I run into frequently). To avoid hardcoding an IP address, you can
    create an "http" data source with a "url" argument pointing to https://ipv4.rawrify.com/ip to grab your public IP!
    Much more clean and portable. <br>
    - Say you don't want to/don't care to implement base64 encoding in your chosen
    language/program. Bam. Here you go. Quick and easy encoding/decoding.
    <h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
    <p>
    I'm a huge fan of extremely lightweight services that deliver only what you
    need, nothing else. Don't get me wrong-- I can appreciate over the top, insanely
    feature rich web apps (RIP Flash game sites), but these lightweight tools hold a special
    place in my personal and professional heart. Other services like icanhazip.com were a huge inspiration for this. <br><br>
    If my first cellphone could open this site, it's something special.
    </p>
    <h2>Do you collect/store my data?</h2>
    <p>
    No. I do not collect nor store any client-specific information on my end. This
    is subject to change if required by law in the future, but I have no plans/desire
    to implement such tracking as of now. Refer to the privacy policy for more information.
